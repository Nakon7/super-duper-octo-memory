Assignment for DA 301

When thinking about investmenting, an important variable to consider is the inflation rate. Inflation is measured as the percent change in the Consumer Price Index from one month to that same month the next year. If you're investing, you want to maximize returns. So, if you're investing you should consider things that might impact your returns like inflation. This project is an attempt to measure inflation's impact on returns of different asset class indexes. 

Prerequisites
In order to accomplish this project, you need to have RStudio installed as well as the packages dplyr, ggplot2, ggthemes, and scales.

The data used is public data pulled from the BLS on what the CPI was over the past 100 years as well as data pulled from a Bloomberg Market Terminal regarding returns for different equity benchmarks. In particular, this is looking at returns of the S&P 500. The idea is to run a regression and see how returns chnge as inflation increases.
